Repository for CS499 Computer Science Capstone at Southern New Hampshire University by Emily Walters.

---

This website serves as my ePortfolio for the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone with Southern New Hampshire University. Throughout this ePortfolio, I will share a professional self-assessment, a code review demonstrating my improvements towards my original artifact, and my three major enhancements in Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases.

My progression through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and through the Capstone for this program shows that I have demonstrated proficiency in the following five outcomes:

Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
Beginning with this professional self-assessment, I can give you a lens into what I have learned and the skills I have refined during my time as a student at Southern New Hampshire University.
